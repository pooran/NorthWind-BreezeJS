NorthWind-BreezeJS
==================

I am using NorthWind db backup from http://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/releases/view/71634

Server side it is WebAPI project with CORS enabled in Web.Config

Client side it is Breeze client with Metadata cached in Localstorage to avoid subsequent metadata calls as recommended in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24205565/in-webapi-breeze-implementation-can-i-avoid-exposing-metadata-funtion/24309887#24309887

This is the demo code built for BDotNet https://www.facebook.com/groups/BDotNet/ event called WebEd http://webed.azurewebsites.net/ or https://www.facebook.com/groups/BDotNet/permalink/785436024830188/
